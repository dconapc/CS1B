 *	food preferences. The program asks for question as
 *	input and outputs what the child will be doing as activities
 *	what food to pack for the child.
 *
 --------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT:
 * 		age - integer of childs age
 * 		name - string with childs name.
 * 		veg - char y/n
 * 		cheese - char y/n
 *
 * 	OUTPUT:
 * 		attraction - string to output childs activities
 * 		meal - string, description of child's meal
 *
